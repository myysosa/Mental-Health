        <p> From the article called “How Can We Support the Mental Health of Young Athletes” which is published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, it says “An example of a type of provider is a sport psychologist, who is a licensed clinical or counseling psychologist with a specialization in sport and performance psychology. Alternatively, mental strength coaches or mental performance consultants vary widely in their educational backgrounds and training, are focused on identifying and treating performance-related concerns, not mental health concerns, and may refer to a licensed mental health provider if a mental health concern is identified.”</p>
